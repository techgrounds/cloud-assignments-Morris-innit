# [Setting Up]
Having some basic programming knowledge is a requirement for a lot of IT jobs. Not much more is required apart from understanding and modifying code snippets to fit your needs. To be able to do this one needs to learn the basic principles of programming.   
Python is often seen as the easiest programming language to learn, because the syntax is very simple. 

## Key-terms

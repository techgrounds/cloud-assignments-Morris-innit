# [Advantages of the Cloud]
Azure states 6 advantages of cloud computing. These are basic characteristics that make the cloud interesting to companies. Keep in mind, this is at the same time a marketing tool to introduce Azure to new clients. This is why it's an important part of the AZ-900 exam. The six advantages of cloud computing are:

1.  High Availability
    Dependant on the service-level agreement (SLA)
2.  Scalability
    Vertical as well as horizontal
3.  Elasticity
4.  Agility
5.  Geo-distribution
6.  Disaster recovery

Azure makes use of a consumption-based model. This means that you only pay for the resources you use. This way, CapEx (Capital Expenditure) is replaced by OpEx (Operational Expenses).

### Experienced problems
I could not find the same 6 advantages as in the introduction. I used the ones I could find on the official Azure website.

**Study:**
-	**The 6 advantages of the cloud**
    -	I could not find the advantages as stated in the introduction. I found the following ones on the website:
        1.	Optimized costs
        There are significant savings in resource, maintenance, and real estate costs, in addition to the ability to optimize workloads so that they cost less to run.

        2.	Flexibility and scalability
        Organizations pay only for the cloud resources that they use, meaning that they don't need to pay for and maintain IT assets that they may only use occasionally.
        When demand spikes or the organization needs more powerful compute resources, organizations can alter their resources instantly on demand.
        To keep getting value from their existing IT investments, many organizations adopt a hybrid cloud model, where they migrate some of their workloads to the cloud while keeping others in their existing on-premises environment. (There can be industry compliance benefits to hybrid clouds, too.)
        Most cloud platforms maintain a global presence so that organizations can improve performance by running workloads closer to where their users or customers are.

        3.	Enhanced security
        Many public clouds have built-in security features and specialized cloud security tools to help ensure that an organization's resources are protected. Security patching is done automatically by the cloud provider in many cases.

        4.	Compliance
        Some cloud platforms have specialized offerings to seamlessly meet compliance requirements—this is ideal for highly regulated industries like finance, healthcare, and government.

        5.	Backup, recovery, and failover
        Most cloud providers help to improve business continuity by offering built-in, one-click backup and recovery capabilities. Some providers also offer the ability to store backups in different geographic regions.

        6.	Simplified management and monitoring
        Organizations can manage and monitor their on-premises datacenter and cloud resources from a single screen if the cloud provider offers a central management tool.

-	**The consumption-based model**
    -	The consumption-based model is a pricing model used in the cloud. It is used to that customers are only charged based on what they actually use. The model is charactarised by:
        -	No associated upfront cost
        -	No wasted resources
        -	Pay for what you need
        -	Stop paying when you don’t use it.  
          
          Consumption is the virtual metric used to calculate how much each resource (service) in Azure was used. Each service has many smaller metrics that track its consumption to offer the best possible pricing model. Those metrics are tracked on a very granular level.

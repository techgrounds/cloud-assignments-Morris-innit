# [Azure Core Services]
This document is to be used as a guide to the AZ-900 certification. It lists the services one should know in more detail. It also describes how to use other services that will be found in the (practice) exam. There are many services in Azure, some being more important than others. Azure lists the following architectural components and services you should have reasonable in-depth knowledge of their use:

- Regions and Region Pairs
- Availability Zones
- Resource Groups
- Subscriptions
- Management Groups
- Azure Resource Manager
- Virtual Machines
- Azure App Services
- Azure Container Instances (ACI)
- Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS)
- Azure Virtual Desktop
- Virtual Networks
- VPN Gateway
- Virtual Network Peering
- ExpressRoute
- Container (Blob) Storage
- Disk Storage
- File Storage
- Storage Tiers
- Cosmos DB
- Azure SQL Database
- Azure Database for MySQL
- Azure Database for PostgreSQL
- SQL Managed Instance
- Azure Marketplace

Of course there are many more services that might come up in your exam. For these services it's enough to be familiar with the product page [(Here's an example of an Azure product page)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/databricks). Other than services, you can also expect questions about different cloud concepts, like High Availability, the consumption-based pricing model, and the shared responsibility model.

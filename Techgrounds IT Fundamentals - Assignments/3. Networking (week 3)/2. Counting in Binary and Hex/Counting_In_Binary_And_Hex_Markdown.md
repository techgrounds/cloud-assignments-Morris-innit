# [Counting in Binary and Hex]
The 1 and 0 counting system on computers is not exactly a 1 and 0 counting system. They represent either the presence, or absence of an electrical signal. 1 representing an electrical signal, and 0 representing its absence. This is called the binary counting system.
These 1's and 0's are called bits. One bit is represented by one digit in a binary number. So when we take 1010, we have 4 digits, making 4 bits.

When you have 8 bits, they become one byte. The highest possible decimal value of a byte is 255 (1111 1111).

With these two numbers it is possible to make any calculation, and count to any number. To understand how IP addresses and subnets work, it is very important to understand binary.

It is common in most human languages to use a decimal system to represent numbers. Decimal means that there are 10 options, or symbols, to represent a number (0-9). When starting from 0, after 9 you run out of symbols to use. We have to add another digit (a 0 to make 10) because of this.

Binary works in the same way. In binary, however, you run out of symbols very quickly (at 1). The next digit we add is 10. This represents the decimal number 2 in binary.

In the hexadecimal (hexa = 6, and deci = 10. So 16) counting system we can add symbols, instead of subtract them. To get to the 16, we add a-f(10-15) as symbols. To reach the definition of hexadecimal, you need to use 0-f. This equals 1 + 15. The hex number 10 equals the decimal number 16. 

IPv6 makes use of hexadecimal numbers. Most colour pickers also use the hexadecimal number system. Since hex goes all the way up to 255 with just two digits (ff), it is very useful. This is because it is the same as the highest value of a byte.

The number of symbols available in a counting system is also known as the base. Binary is base 2, decimal is base 10, and hexadecimal is base 16.

### Experienced problems
The introduction left me a little confused as to how the hexadecimal counting system worked. I looked it up some more. I'm continuing in good faith that I'll understand it in due course. I half understand the idea, not so much how to use it.

After doing the exercises I understand how to use the hexadecimal counting system.
